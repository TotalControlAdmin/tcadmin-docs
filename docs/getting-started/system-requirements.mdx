## Manual Installation Dependancies

:::warning
Prior knowledge of Linux server management is required. TCAdmin support does not provide instruction on tasks such as logging in to your server using Putty, executing commands, or installing dependencies for game/voice servers or tools.
:::

:::danger
A swap partition is required. Mono is unstable when the server is configured without swap space.
:::

:::warning
If you accidentally install Mono 4 you must uninstall it before installing Mono 6.
