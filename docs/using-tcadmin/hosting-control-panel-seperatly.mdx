# Hosting the control panel website separately

## Requirements

If you want to host the control panel website on a separate server without requiring an additional license you will need:

- Remote desktop or SSH access to the web server
- TCAdmin **2.0.152.1** or greater
- TCAdmin configured with a MySQL database
- Low latency from MySQL to the web server

## Limitations

- When you update TCAdmin the seperate control panel needs to be [updated manually](/getting-started/updating#manual-update)
- Some modules might not be compatible
- Built in DDoS protection for the control panel is not available

## Configure the master to accept connections from the web server

- The master should already be configured and have a working control panel.
- Go to `Server Management (on the left-hand navigation)` > `Servers` > `Master` > `Server IPs`. Add the web server's IP but **disable game and voice servers on it**.

## Installation of the website on Linux

- Install Mono and TCAdmin as you would normally. You don't need to run the configuration utility to enter a license.
- Download the [Hosting.zip](/downloads/Hosting.zip), extract and edit with notepad or your favorite text editor.

:::tip
We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for all configuration edits that need to be made. If your password contains HTML characters that need to be escaped (<>&'",etc) you can use this tool: http://htmlencode.net/
:::

- Update the value of `TCAdmin.ConfigUtility.Database.ConnectionString` with the information required to make the connection to the MySQL server.
- Save your updated `Hosting.config` to your web server in the path `/home/tcadmin/Monitor/Hosting.config`
- Restart the web server's monitor:

```bash
/home/tcadmin/Monitor/monitor-service restart
```

- After restarting the monitor you should be able to log in to the control panel and test the connection to the master in `Server Management (on the left-hand navigation)` > `Servers` > `Show Versions`.
- After the control panel is working correctly you can [configure the control panel website to run with Nginx](/customizations/web-server-configurations/setting-up-nginx) for improved performance.

## Installation of the website on Windows

- Install TCAdmin as you would normally. You don't need to run the configuration utility to enter a license.
- Download the [Hosting.zip](/downloads/Hosting.zip), extract and edit with notepad or your favorite text editor.

- Update the value of `TCAdmin.ConfigUtility.Database.ConnectionString` with the information required to make the connection to the MySQL server.
- Save your updated Hosting.config to your web server in the path `C:\Program Files\TCAdmin2\Monitor\Hosting.config`
- On the web server go to `Start` > `Services` and restart the TCAdmin Monitor service.
- After restarting the monitor you should be able to log in to the control panel and test the connection to the master in `Server Management (on the left-hand navigation)` > `Servers` > `Show Versions`.
- After the control panel is working correctly you can [configure the control panel website to run with IIS](/customizations/web-server-configurations/setting-up-iis) for improved performance.

## Disable the master's control panel

Execute this command on your database if you want to disable the master's built in web server.

```sql
DELETE FROM tc_server_enabled_components WHERE module_id = '07405876-e8c2-4b24-a774-4ef57f596384' AND component_id = 2 AND server_id = 1;
```

## Enable the master's control panel (optional)

If you ever need to enable the built in web server again execute this command.

```sql
INSERT INTO tc_server_enabled_components (module_id, component_id, server_id) values ('07405876-e8c2-4b24-a774-4ef57f596384', 2, 1);
```
