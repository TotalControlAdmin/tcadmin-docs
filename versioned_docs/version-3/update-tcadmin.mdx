# Update TCAdmin

When a new version of TCAdmin is released, you can update using a single command. The updater handles everything — downloading, installing, database changes, and restarting services.

:::tip How do I know if there's an update?
Check the TCAdmin announcements or community channels for new releases. Running the update command will tell you if you're already on the latest version.
:::

## How to Update

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

Open **PowerShell** or **Command Prompt** as **Administrator** and run:

```powershell
tca update
```

If `tca` is not recognized (meaning it's not in your PATH), navigate to the CLI directory first:

```powershell
cd "C:\Program Files\TCAdmin3\cli"
.\tca update
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
./tca update
```

If `tca` is not recognized, navigate to the CLI directory first:

```bash
cd /opt/tcadmin3/cli
./tca update
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## What Happens During the Update

The update process is automatic. Here's what it does behind the scenes:

1. **Stops** the TCAdmin services (Monitor and Web) — game servers keep running, but you can't manage them during the update
2. **Downloads** the latest version
3. **Installs** the updated files
4. **Applies database migrations** — updates the database structure if the new version requires it
5. **Restarts** the TCAdmin services

:::info Game servers stay running
The update only restarts the TCAdmin management services, not your actual game servers. Players won't be disconnected during the update.
:::

## After Updating

Verify that the services came back up successfully:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```powershell
Get-Service TCA3Monitor, TCA3Web
```

Both should show a status of **Running**.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

```bash
sudo systemctl status tca3monitor tca3web
```

Both should show **active (running)**.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then open your control panel in the browser to confirm everything is working. You can check the version number in the panel footer or settings page.

:::tip Something went wrong?
If a service doesn't start after updating, run it in [Console Mode](troubleshooting/console-mode.mdx) to see the error messages and figure out what happened.
