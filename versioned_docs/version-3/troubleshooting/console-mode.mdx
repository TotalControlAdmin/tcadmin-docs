# Running in Console Mode

If the TCAdmin Monitor or Web service isn't starting properly, you can run it in **console mode** to see exactly what's going wrong. Instead of running silently in the background as a service, console mode prints all log messages directly to your terminal so you can spot errors.

:::tip When to use this
Console mode is your first troubleshooting step when:
- The TCAdmin panel doesn't load in your browser
- Game servers aren't starting or being managed
- A service shows as "Stopped" and won't start
- You recently changed a configuration and something broke
:::

## Step 1: Stop the Service

Before running in console mode, stop the background service first (you can't run both at the same time):

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

Open PowerShell as Administrator:

```powershell
# Stop the Monitor service
Stop-Service TCA3Monitor

# Stop the Web service
Stop-Service TCA3Web
```

**Alternative:** You can also stop services using the Windows GUI:
1. Press `Win + R`, type `services.msc`, and press Enter
2. Find **TCAdmin 3.0 Monitor** or **TCAdmin 3.0 Control Panel**
3. Right-click and select **Stop**

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

```bash
# Stop the Monitor service
sudo systemctl stop tca3monitor

# Stop the Web service
sudo systemctl stop tca3web
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Run in Console Mode

Navigate to the component directory and run the executable directly. All log output will appear in your terminal.

:::note Heads up (Windows)
Switching the Web service between service mode and console mode will **log out all users** currently using the panel. This is normal.
:::

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```powershell
# Run the Monitor in console mode
cd "C:\Program Files\TCAdmin3\components\monitor"
.\TCAdmin.Monitor.exe

# OR run the Web in console mode
cd "C:\Program Files\TCAdmin3\components\web"
.\TCAdmin.Web.exe
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

```bash
# Run the Monitor in console mode
cd /opt/tcadmin3/components/monitor
./TCAdmin.Monitor

# OR run the Web in console mode
cd /opt/tcadmin3/components/web
./TCAdmin.Web
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Read the Output

The terminal will show log messages as the service starts up. Here's what to look for:

- **Error** or **Fatal** messages — these are the problems you need to fix
- **Exception** details with stack traces — technical details about what went wrong
- **Configuration** errors — something is wrong in your settings files
- **Database** connection issues — TCAdmin can't reach MySQL
- **Network** or port errors — another program is using the same port

### Common Errors and Fixes

| Error | What It Means | How to Fix It |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| Port already in use | Another program is already using the port TCAdmin needs | Find and stop the conflicting program, or change the port in the TCAdmin config file |
| Database connection failed | TCAdmin can't connect to MySQL — wrong credentials, or MySQL isn't running | Check that MySQL/MariaDB is running, and verify the username, password, host, and database name in `config/appsettings.global.json` |
| Certificate error | The SSL certificate is missing or invalid | Check the certificate path in `config/web/appsettings.Overrides.json`, or regenerate a certificate using the [Web Certificate](../getting-started/initial-configuration/web-certificate.mdx) guide |
| Redis connection failed | TCAdmin can't connect to Redis | Verify Redis is running and check the Redis settings in the configuration. On a master server, the built-in Redis should start automatically. |

:::tip Copy the error message
If you need to ask for help, copy the full error message from the terminal. The more detail you provide, the faster someone can help you diagnose the issue.
:::

## Step 4: Restart the Service

Once you've identified and fixed the issue, stop the console process by pressing `Ctrl+C`, then restart the normal background service:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```powershell
# Start the Monitor service
Start-Service TCA3Monitor

# Start the Web service
Start-Service TCA3Web
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

```bash
# Start the Monitor service
sudo systemctl start tca3monitor

# Start the Web service
sudo systemctl start tca3web
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

After starting the service, verify it's running:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```powershell
Get-Service TCA3Monitor, TCA3Web
```

Both should show a status of **Running**.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

```bash
sudo systemctl status tca3monitor tca3web
```

Both should show **active (running)**.

  </TabItem>
