# Version 3.0.867.2669

### New Features

- **Encrypted credentials** — Database and game (TCA3Game) credentials are now encrypted for improved security.
- **Private networks** — Implemented support for private networks, allowing servers to communicate over internal network interfaces.
- **Restart services from panel** — You can now restart the Monitor and Web services directly from within TCAdmin.
- **Monitor & Web log viewer** — You can now view Master Monitor and Web service logs directly from the control panel.
- **Desktop & shell sessions** — Added the ability to open a remote desktop or shell session from the panel.
- **Community plugin repository** — Added a community plugin repository, giving you access to shared game configurations and scripts from the community.
- **Share to plugin repository** — You can now share your game configurations and scripts directly to a plugin repository from within TCAdmin using a GitHub token.
- **Insert variables in command lines** — Added a dialog to easily insert variables when editing game server command lines.
- **`ThisService.ProcessId`** — Added `ThisService.ProcessId` so scripts can access the current game server's process ID.
- **Repository links** — Added repository URL links in Games and Docker Services for quick access.
- **Custom loading screen** — Added an option to change the default page loading screen text (previously hardcoded to "TCADMIN").

### Bug Fixes

- **Admin user creation** — Fixed a bug where an admin account could not create other admin accounts.
- **Port allocation error** — Fixed a "could not find available port" error that occurred when the port was set to 0.
- **Desktop interaction** — Fixed an issue where interacting with the desktop session failed when the Windows session was locked.
- **Game servers killed on monitor stop (Linux)** — Fixed an issue where stopping the monitor service on Linux would also terminate running game servers. ServiceIO processes are now launched in a separate systemd scope so they are no longer affected by the monitor's service lifecycle.
