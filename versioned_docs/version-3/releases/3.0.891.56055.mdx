# Version 3.0.891.56055

### New Features

- **Config file editors in service creation wizard** — Game configuration file editors are now shown during game service creation, allowing you to configure game settings before the service is installed.
- **Resource limits in service creation** — You can now specify resource limits (CPU, memory, etc.) when creating a game or Docker service, giving you control over resource allocation from the start.
- **Service settings pages** — Added dedicated settings pages to game and Docker services, providing a centralized place to view and manage service configuration.
- **Service limits in server settings** — You can now configure maximum game and Docker service limits per server directly from the server settings page.
- **Update availability health check** — The System Health page now checks for newer TCAdmin versions and shows the available update information.

### Bug Fixes

- **Docker service memory limit** — Fixed an error when starting a Docker service with a memory limit configured.
- **Monitor FTP crash** — Fixed a crash in the monitor caused by the FTP server by updating the FTP server library.
- **Config editor save** — Fixed an error when saving configuration file variables.
