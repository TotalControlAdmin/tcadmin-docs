# System Requirements

Before installing TCAdmin, make sure your server meets the requirements below. TCAdmin v3 is built on .NET 9, so it runs on most modern Windows and Linux servers.

:::tip Not sure what server to get?
If you're just starting out, a **Windows Server 2022** or **Ubuntu 24.04** VPS/dedicated server with at least **4 GB RAM** and **2 CPU cores** is a solid starting point. You can always scale up later.

### Dependencies

#### MySQL Database (Required)

TCAdmin stores all of its data (users, game servers, settings) in a MySQL-compatible database. You need to install one before setting up TCAdmin.

We recommend **[MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/download)** — it's free, open-source, and fully compatible with MySQL. Install it on the same machine as TCAdmin for the best performance.

:::tip First time with MySQL/MariaDB?
During the MariaDB installer, you'll be asked to set a **root password** — remember this! You'll use it later when configuring TCAdmin. You can also create a dedicated `tcadmin3` database user during setup (recommended for security).
:::

#### Required by Some Games

These are **not** needed for TCAdmin itself, but certain game servers won't run without them. Install these if you plan to host the types of games listed:

- [Microsoft Visual C++ **(x64)**](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) 2015 to 2022 — needed by most Source engine and Unreal engine games
- [Microsoft Visual C++ **(x86)**](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe) 2015 to 2022 — needed by some older 32-bit game servers
- [DirectX](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35&6B49FDFB-8E5B-4B07-BC31-15695C5A2143=1) — needed by a handful of game servers
- Java — **required for Minecraft.** We recommend the [Adoptium variant](https://adoptium.net/)

:::tip Just install the Visual C++ runtimes
Even if you're not sure which games you'll host, installing both Visual C++ runtimes (x64 and x86) is a good idea — they're needed by the majority of game servers and take seconds to install.
:::

#### Optional

- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/) or [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) — only needed if you want to run game servers inside Docker containers

:::tip Recommended for beginners
If you're new to Linux, **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS** or **Debian 12** are the easiest to work with and have the most community support.

### Dependencies

#### MySQL Database (Required)

TCAdmin stores all of its data (users, game servers, settings) in a MySQL-compatible database. You need to install one before setting up TCAdmin.

We recommend **[MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/download)** — it's free, open-source, and fully compatible with MySQL. Install it on the same machine as TCAdmin for the best performance.

:::warning Linux Knowledge Required
TCAdmin support does not provide instruction on basic Linux tasks such as logging in via SSH, executing commands, or installing OS-level dependencies. If you're new to Linux, we recommend learning the basics of SSH, package managers (`apt`, `dnf`), and file permissions before proceeding.
:::

#### Required by Some Games

- **32-bit libraries for SteamCMD** — most Steam game servers need 32-bit libraries installed on your 64-bit Linux system. Follow the [SteamCMD guide](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD#32-Bit_Libraries_on_64-Bit_Linux_Systems) to install them.
- Java — **required for Minecraft.** We recommend the [Adoptium variant](https://adoptium.net/)

#### Optional

- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) — only needed if you want to run game servers inside Docker containers

### Windows & Linux

:::info Running Multiple Servers?

If you plan to add **remote servers** (additional machines to host more game servers), the MySQL database on your master server must be accessible from all your TCAdmin servers over the network. You'll configure this connection during installation.

If you're only running a single server, you don't need to worry about this — just install MySQL on the same machine.

:::

## What's Next?

Once your server meets these requirements, proceed to the installation guide for your operating system:

- [Linux Installation](Installation/linux-installation.mdx)
