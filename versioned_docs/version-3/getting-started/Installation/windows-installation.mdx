# Windows Installation

This guide walks you through installing TCAdmin on a Windows server. The process takes about 5-10 minutes.

## Before You Begin

Make sure you have:

- A Windows server that meets the [System Requirements](../system-requirements.mdx)
- **MariaDB or MySQL** installed and running (see [System Requirements](../system-requirements.mdx) for details)
- Your MySQL **username, password, and database name** ready (you'll need these during setup)
- **Administrator access** to the server

:::tip Don't have MySQL set up yet?
Install [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/download) first. During the MariaDB installer, set a root password and remember it. You can use the root account for TCAdmin, or create a dedicated `tcadmin3` user for better security.
:::

## Install TCAdmin

1. Open **PowerShell** as Administrator.
   - Right-click the Start menu and select **Windows PowerShell (Admin)** or **Terminal (Admin)**

2. Run the following command to download and start the installer:

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm "https://v3.tcafiles.com/win-x64-beta.ps1")))
```

3. The installer will walk you through a series of prompts (component selection, database setup, etc.). For a detailed explanation of each step, see the [Master Server Configuration](../initial-configuration/master-server-configuration.mdx) guide.

:::info What does this command do?
It downloads the official TCAdmin installer script from `v3.tcafiles.com` and runs it. The script installs the TCAdmin components, sets up Windows Services, and configures the initial settings based on your answers to the prompts.
:::

## After Installation

Once the installer finishes:

- The **TCAdmin Monitor** and **TCAdmin Web** services will start automatically
- Your control panel will be available at **`https://127.0.0.1:31001`** (or `https://YOUR-SERVER-IP:31001` from another computer)
- Default login: **admin** / **Password!23**

:::warning Browser Security Warning
Your browser will show a security warning because TCAdmin uses a self-signed certificate by default. This is normal — click "Advanced" and then "Proceed" to continue. You can set up a proper certificate later using the [Web Certificate](../initial-configuration/web-certificate.mdx) guide.
