# Linux Installation

This guide walks you through installing TCAdmin on a Linux server. The automated installer handles all dependencies for you and takes about 5-10 minutes.

## Before You Begin

Make sure you have:

- A Linux server that meets the [System Requirements](../system-requirements.mdx)
- **MariaDB or MySQL** installed and running (see [System Requirements](../system-requirements.mdx) for details)
- Your MySQL **username, password, and database name** ready (you'll need these during setup)
- **Root access** (or a user with `sudo` privileges)
- An **SSH connection** to your server (using a tool like PuTTY, your hosting provider's web console, or a terminal)

:::tip Don't have MySQL set up yet?
Install MariaDB first. On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install mariadb-server`, then run `sudo mysql_secure_installation` to set a root password. On RHEL-based distros: `sudo dnf install mariadb-server` and `sudo systemctl start mariadb`.
:::

## Install TCAdmin

Run the automated installer as **root**:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://v3.tcafiles.com/linux-beta.sh)
```

:::tip Using sudo instead of root?
If you're not logged in as root, prefix the command with `sudo`:

```bash
sudo bash <(curl -fsSL https://v3.tcafiles.com/linux-beta.sh)
```
:::

:::info What does this command do?
It downloads the official TCAdmin installer script from `v3.tcafiles.com` and runs it. The script will:
- Install any missing system dependencies automatically
- Download the TCAdmin components
- Set up systemd services so TCAdmin starts on boot
- Walk you through configuration prompts (component selection, database setup, etc.)
:::

The installer will ask you a series of questions (component selection, database setup, etc.). For a detailed explanation of each step, see the [Master Server Configuration](../initial-configuration/master-server-configuration.mdx) guide.

## After Installation

Once the installer finishes:

- The **TCAdmin Monitor** and **TCAdmin Web** services will start automatically
- Your control panel will be available at **`https://YOUR-SERVER-IP:31001`** from your browser
- Default login: **admin** / **Password!23**

:::warning Browser Security Warning
Your browser will show a security warning because TCAdmin uses a self-signed certificate by default. This is normal — click "Advanced" and then "Proceed" to continue. You can set up a proper certificate later using the [Web Certificate](../initial-configuration/web-certificate.mdx) guide.
:::

:::tip Can't connect?
If you can't reach the panel in your browser, check that port **31001** is open in your firewall:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian (UFW)
sudo ufw allow 31001

# RHEL/CentOS/AlmaLinux (firewalld)
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=31001/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```
:::

## What's Next?

Follow the [Master Server Configuration](../initial-configuration/master-server-configuration.mdx) guide for a detailed walkthrough of the installer prompts and your first login.
