# Web Certificate

By default, TCAdmin uses a self-signed certificate for HTTPS, which causes your browser to show a security warning every time you visit the panel. This guide shows you how to replace it with a free, trusted certificate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) so the warning goes away.

:::info What is an SSL certificate?
An SSL certificate encrypts the connection between your browser and the TCAdmin panel, keeping your login credentials and data safe. A **self-signed** certificate provides encryption but isn't trusted by browsers (hence the warning). A **Let's Encrypt** certificate is free, trusted by all browsers, and auto-renews.
:::

## Before You Begin

You need **one** of the following:
- A **domain name** pointing to your server (e.g., `panel.yourdomain.com`) — set up a DNS **A record** that points to your server's public IP address
- **OR** you can use TCAdmin's built-in dynamic DNS (explained below) if you don't have a domain

You also need:
- Ports **80** and **443** open and accessible from the internet (Let's Encrypt uses port 80 to verify you own the domain)
- No other web server (like Apache or Nginx) running on ports 80/443

## Step 1: Change TCAdmin to Use Ports 80 and 443

By default, TCAdmin runs on ports 31000/31001. Let's Encrypt requires your site to be on the standard web ports (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS).

Edit the web configuration file:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

Edit `C:\Program Files\TCAdmin3\config\web\appsettings.Production.json`:

```json
{
  "TCAdmin": {
    "Type": "Web",
    "Web": {
      "Port": 80,
      "SecurePort": 443,
      "Prerender": true
    }
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

Edit `/opt/tcadmin3/config/web/appsettings.Production.json`:

```json
{
  "TCAdmin": {
    "Type": "Web",
    "Web": {
      "Port": 80,
      "SecurePort": 443,
      "Prerender": true
    }
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Restart the Web Service

After editing the config, restart the web service for the changes to take effect:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```powershell
Restart-Service TCA3Web
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

```bash
sudo systemctl restart tca3web
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::warning Don't forget the firewall
Make sure ports **80** and **443** are open in your firewall. Let's Encrypt connects to port 80 to verify that you control the domain — if it can't reach your server, certificate generation will fail.
:::

:::tip After switching ports
Your panel URL changes too! Instead of `https://YOUR-IP:31001`, you'll now access it at `https://YOUR-IP` (port 443 is the default HTTPS port, so you don't need to type it).
:::

## Step 2: Generate the Certificate

1. Log in to your control panel
2. Go to **Settings** > **Web Certificate**
3. In the **Domains** field, enter your domain name (one per line if you have multiple)
4. Optionally enter your **Email** address — Let's Encrypt will send you a reminder if your certificate is about to expire
5. Check **Accept terms of service** (after reviewing the [Let's Encrypt Terms of Service](https://letsencrypt.org/repository/))
6. Click **Create**

TCAdmin will:
1. Create a test certificate first to make sure everything works
2. If the test passes, create the real certificate
3. Automatically configure the web service to use it

:::tip Don't have a domain name?
TCAdmin offers a free dynamic DNS service. Use this as your domain:

```
YOUR-PUBLIC-IP.dyn.tcadmin.net
```

Replace dots in your IP with dashes. For example, if your IP is `192.168.1.100`, use:

```
192-168-1-100.dyn.tcadmin.net
```
:::

## Checking Your Certificate

After generating a certificate, the **Web Certificate** page shows:

| Field | What It Shows |
|-------|---------------|
| **Domain** | The domain name the certificate was issued for |
| **Expires on** | When the certificate expires (Let's Encrypt certs last 90 days) |
| **Issued by** | Who issued the certificate (Let's Encrypt or self-signed) |

## Automatic Renewal

Let's Encrypt certificates are valid for **90 days**. TCAdmin automatically renews them before they expire — you don't need to do anything.

## Troubleshooting

### "Website must be accessible over http on port 80"

The web service isn't listening on port 80. Go back to [Step 1](#step-1-change-tcadmin-to-use-ports-80-and-443) and make sure you updated the config file and restarted the service.

### Certificate generation fails

| Possible Cause | How to Fix |
|----------------|-----------|
| **Port 80 not accessible** | Open port 80 in your firewall. Test by visiting `http://YOUR-DOMAIN` — you should see the TCAdmin panel (without HTTPS). |
| **Domain doesn't point to your server** | Make sure your domain's DNS A record points to your server's public IP. You can check with `nslookup YOUR-DOMAIN` or an online DNS checker. DNS changes can take up to 24 hours to propagate, but usually take 5-30 minutes. |
| **Rate limiting** | Let's Encrypt limits how many certificates you can request per domain per week. If you've been testing repeatedly, wait an hour and try again. |
| **Another service on port 80** | If Apache, Nginx, or another web server is using port 80, stop it first. Only one service can listen on a port at a time. |
