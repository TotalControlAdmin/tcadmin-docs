# Master Server Configuration

This guide walks you through the TCAdmin installer prompts and your first login. By the end, you'll have a fully working control panel.

:::info What is a "Master Server"?
The master server is your **main** TCAdmin server. It runs the database, the web-based control panel, and the monitor service that manages game servers. If you're only setting up one machine, this is what you need. You can add more servers (called "remote servers") later if you want to scale up.
:::

## The Installer Prompts

After running the installer (from the [Windows](../Installation/windows-installation.mdx) or [Linux](../Installation/linux-installation.mdx) guide), you'll be asked a series of questions. Here's what each one means:

### 1. Select Components

The installer asks which components to install:
- **monitor** — the background service that manages game servers (starts them, stops them, monitors their health)
- **web** — the control panel website you'll use in your browser

**For a master server, select both.** Both are required for a complete installation.

### 2. Installation Directory

Choose where TCAdmin files will be stored on disk. You can press **Enter** to accept the default:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

**Default:** `C:\Program Files\TCAdmin3`

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

**Default:** `/opt/tcadmin3`

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
The default location works well for most setups. Only change this if you have a specific reason (like a different drive with more disk space).
:::

### 3. Server Type

Choose whether this is a **Master** or **Remote** server:
- **Master (primary server with database)** — the main server that hosts the database and coordinates everything
- **Remote (connects to existing master)** — an additional server that connects to an existing master

**For your first installation, always select Master.**

### 4. Database Configuration

This is where you tell TCAdmin how to connect to your MySQL/MariaDB database. Enter the following details:

| Prompt | What to Enter | Default |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| **MySQL IP or hostname** | The address of your MySQL server. If MySQL is on the same machine, use `localhost`. | `localhost` |
| **MySQL port** | The port MySQL listens on. Unless you changed it, use the default. | `3306` |
| **MySQL username** | A MySQL user with permissions to create and modify tables. `root` works for testing, but a dedicated user like `tcadmin3` is better for production. | — |
| **MySQL password** | The password for the MySQL user you entered above. | — |
| **MySQL database** | The database name to use. TCAdmin will create it if it doesn't exist (and your user has CREATE privileges). | `tcadmin3` |

:::tip Don't have a database user yet?
If you installed MariaDB/MySQL and only have the `root` user, that's fine for getting started. You can create a dedicated user later. If you want to create one now, connect to MySQL and run:

```sql
CREATE USER 'tcadmin3'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YourPasswordHere';
CREATE DATABASE tcadmin3;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON tcadmin3.* TO 'tcadmin3'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
:::

### 5. Add to PATH

The installer asks if you want to add the TCAdmin command-line tool (`tca`) to your system PATH. This lets you run `tca` commands from any terminal window without navigating to the installation directory first.

**Recommended: Yes.** It makes updating and managing TCAdmin easier later.

## Back Up Your Encryption Key

:::danger This is the most important step — do not skip it!
After installation, the installer displays a **Master Encryption Key**. This key is used to encrypt all sensitive data in your database (passwords, API keys, etc.).

**You MUST save this key somewhere safe:**
- Copy it to a password manager (like Bitwarden, 1Password, or KeePass)
- Write it down and store it in a secure location
- **Do NOT** store it on the same server as TCAdmin (if that server dies, you lose the key too)
- Keep backups in multiple places

**If you lose this key, your encrypted data is gone forever — there is no recovery option.**
:::

## Log In to Your Control Panel

Now it's time to open the control panel in your browser!

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

Open your browser and go to **`https://127.0.0.1:31001`** from the server itself, or **`https://YOUR-SERVER-IP:31001`** from another computer (replace with your server's actual IP address).

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

Open your browser on your own computer (not the server) and go to **`https://YOUR-SERVER-IP:31001`** (replace with your server's actual IP address).

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info Default Login Credentials

Username: **admin**

Password: **Password!23**

:::

:::tip Can't connect?
If the page doesn't load:
- **Check your firewall** — ports **31000** (HTTP) and **31001** (HTTPS) need to be open
- If your server is behind a router (NAT), you'll need to set up **port forwarding** for these ports
- Wait 30 seconds after installation for the services to fully start
:::

:::note About the Browser Security Warning
The installer creates a self-signed HTTPS certificate, so your browser will show a security warning the first time. This is expected and safe — just click "Advanced" > "Proceed" (Chrome) or "Accept the Risk" (Firefox). You can replace this with a proper certificate later using the [Web Certificate](web-certificate.mdx) guide.
:::

## Getting Started Widget

After logging in, you'll see a **Getting Started** widget on your dashboard. It walks you through the essential first-time setup:

### 1. Change Your Password

Click **Change Password** and set a strong, unique password. You won't be able to proceed until this is done — it's there to keep your server safe.

### 2. Configure Your License

Click on the server name in the widget to enter your TCAdmin license key. Your license unlocks the ability to import games from the Plugin Repository and enables all features.

:::info Don't have a license key yet?
You can use your existing TCAdmin v2 master license key to preview v3.
:::

### 3. Import Game Configurations

Click **Import** to open the Plugin Repository and install pre-built game configurations. This is the fastest way to get started — the repository has ready-to-go setups for popular games like **Minecraft, CS2, Rust, ARK**, and many more.

You can also click **Skip** if you'd rather configure games manually later.

### 4. Import Docker Configurations

If you want to run game servers inside Docker containers, click **Import** to install Docker blueprint configurations. Otherwise, click **Skip**.

Once you've completed all the steps, the widget shows a success message. Your TCAdmin panel is ready to use!
