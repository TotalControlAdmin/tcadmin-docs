# Master Server Configuration

How to get going with TCAdmin once installed.

## Installation Process

After running the TCAdmin installer, you will be prompted with the following:

### 1. Select Components

Select the components to install:
- **monitor** - The TCAdmin Monitor service that manages game servers
- **web** - The TCAdmin Control Panel web interface

Both components are required for a master server installation.

### 2. Installation Directory

Enter the installation directory or press Enter to use the default:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

**Default:** `C:\Program Files\TCAdmin3`

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

**Default:** `/opt/tcadmin3`

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 3. Server Type

Select whether this is a **Master** or **Remote** server:
- **Master (primary server with database)** - The main server that hosts the database and coordinates all operations
- **Remote (connects to existing master)** - Additional servers that connect to an existing master installation

For your first installation, select **Master**.

### 4. Database Configuration

Enter your MySQL database connection details:
- **MySQL IP or hostname** - The address of your MySQL server (default: `localhost`)
- **MySQL port** - The port MySQL is listening on (default: `3306`)
- **MySQL username** - A MySQL user with permissions to create/modify tables
- **MySQL password** - The password for the MySQL user
- **MySQL database** - The database name (default: `tcadmin3`)

:::tip
If the database doesn't exist and your MySQL user has CREATE privileges, the installer will offer to create it for you.
:::

### 5. Add to PATH

Choose whether to add the TCAdmin CLI (`tca`) to your system PATH for easy access from any terminal.

## Backup Your Encryption Key

:::danger Critical Security Step
After installation completes, you will be shown a **Master Encryption Key**. This key is used to encrypt all sensitive data in your database.

**You MUST backup this key securely:**
- Store it in a password manager or secure vault
- Do NOT store it on the same server as TCAdmin
- Keep multiple secure backups in different locations
- This key is required for disaster recovery

**If you lose this key, you will NOT be able to decrypt your data!**

## Access Your Control Panel

:::info Default Credentials

Username: **admin**

Password: **Password!23**

:::

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

View `https://127.0.0.1:31001` using the server's browser or `https://public_server_ip:31001` using your PC's browser.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

View `https://public_server_ip:31001` using your PC's browser.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
If you are using NAT, make sure you have port forwarded in Windows Firewall, your router, or iptables/ufw.

**Default Ports:**
- HTTP: `31000`
- HTTPS: `31001`
:::

:::note Self-Signed Certificate
The installer creates a self-signed certificate for HTTPS connections. Your browser will show a security warning - this is expected. You can proceed past the warning or configure a trusted certificate later.
:::

## Getting Started

After logging in, you will see the **Getting Started** widget on your dashboard. This widget guides you through the essential setup tasks to get your TCAdmin system ready.

### 1. Change Your Password

Secure your account by changing the default password. Click the **Change Password** button in the widget to update your password.

:::warning
You must change the default password before proceeding with other setup tasks.
:::

### 2. Configure Your License

Set up a valid license for your server to unlock all features. Click on the server name in the widget to open the license configuration dialog.

Enter your license key to activate your TCAdmin installation. Without a valid license, you will not be able to import games or Docker configurations from the plugin repository.

### 3. Import Game Configurations

Add game and voice service configurations to start hosting game servers. Click **Import** to browse and install game configurations from the TCAdmin plugin repository.

You can also click **Skip** if you plan to configure games manually later.

:::tip
The plugin repository contains pre-configured settings for popular games like Minecraft, CS2, Rust, ARK, and many more.
:::

### 4. Import Docker Configurations

Set up Docker blueprints for containerized services. Click **Import** to browse available Docker configurations from the plugin repository.

You can also click **Skip** if you don't plan to use Docker containers.

Once all tasks are completed, the widget will display a success message and you can close it. Your TCAdmin system is now ready to use!
