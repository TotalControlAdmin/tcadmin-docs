# Windows Auto-Logon

Some game servers require the "Interact with Desktop" option to be enabled, which requires a user to be logged in to Windows. TCAdmin provides commands to configure Windows auto-logon securely.

:::info Windows Only
This feature is only available on Windows servers.
:::

## Why Auto-Logon?

When a game server is configured with "Interact with Desktop" enabled, it needs access to the Windows desktop session. For these games to start automatically when the server boots, a user must be logged in. Auto-logon ensures a user session is available after every restart.

## Enable Auto-Logon

Open **PowerShell** or **Command Prompt** as Administrator and run:

```powershell
tca enable-autologon
```

You will be prompted to enter:

1. **Username** - The Windows user account to log in automatically
2. **Password** - The password for the account (entered securely, confirmed twice)
3. **Domain** - The domain name (defaults to local computer name)

The command will verify the credentials before enabling auto-logon.

### Command Options

You can also provide credentials directly:

```powershell
tca enable-autologon --username Administrator --password YourPassword --domain COMPUTERNAME
```

| Option | Alias | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--username` | `-u` | Username for auto-logon |
| `--password` | `-p` | Password for auto-logon |
| `--domain` | `-d` | Domain name (defaults to local computer) |
| `--force` | `-f` | Force auto-logon (ignore Shift key bypass) |

:::tip Security
The password is stored securely using Windows LSA Secrets (encrypted), similar to the Sysinternals Autologon tool. The password is not stored in plain text in the registry.
:::

## Disable Auto-Logon

To disable auto-logon and remove stored credentials:

```powershell
tca disable-autologon
```

You will be asked to confirm before disabling. To skip the confirmation:

```powershell
tca disable-autologon --yes
```

This removes all stored passwords and disables automatic login.
