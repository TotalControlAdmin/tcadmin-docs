# Windows Auto-Logon

Some game servers need to interact with the Windows desktop to work properly. For these games, a Windows user must be logged in at all times — including after the server reboots. TCAdmin provides a built-in command to set this up securely.

:::tip Do you actually need this?
Most game servers work fine **without** auto-logon. You only need it if a specific game requires the "Interact with Desktop" option to be enabled in its TCAdmin configuration. If you're not sure, skip this for now — you can always set it up later.

## What Auto-Logon Does

Normally, after a Windows server reboots, it sits at the login screen waiting for someone to type in a password. If a game server needs desktop access to run, it can't start until someone logs in.

Auto-logon solves this by automatically logging in a Windows user account every time the server starts up. The game server can then start normally without anyone needing to manually log in.

## Enable Auto-Logon

Open **PowerShell** or **Command Prompt** as Administrator and run:

```powershell
tca enable-autologon
```

You'll be asked for:

1. **Username** — the Windows user account to log in automatically (e.g., `Administrator`)
2. **Password** — the password for that account (you'll type it twice to confirm)
3. **Domain** — the domain name (just press Enter to use the local computer name — this is correct for most setups)

The command verifies your credentials are correct before enabling auto-logon.

### One-Line Version

If you prefer, you can pass everything in a single command:

```powershell
tca enable-autologon --username Administrator --password YourPassword --domain COMPUTERNAME
```

| Option | Short Form | What It Does |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| `--username` | `-u` | The Windows user account |
| `--password` | `-p` | The password for the account |
| `--domain` | `-d` | The domain (defaults to local computer name) |
| `--force` | `-f` | Skip the Shift-key bypass check |

:::tip Is this secure?
Yes. The password is stored using **Windows LSA Secrets** (encrypted), the same method used by Microsoft's own Sysinternals Autologon tool. The password is **not** stored in plain text in the registry.

## Disable Auto-Logon

To turn off auto-logon and remove the stored credentials:

```powershell
tca disable-autologon
```

You'll be asked to confirm. To skip the confirmation prompt:

```powershell
tca disable-autologon --yes
```

This removes the stored password and disables automatic login.
