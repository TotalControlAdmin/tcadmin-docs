# Plugin Repository

The Plugin Repository is like an **app store for your TCAdmin panel**. It lets you browse, install, and update pre-built game configurations, Docker blueprints, scripts, themes, and language packs — so you don't have to set everything up from scratch.

:::tip This is the fastest way to start hosting games
Instead of manually configuring every game server setting, just open the Plugin Repository, find the game you want (Minecraft, CS2, Rust, ARK, etc.), and click Install. TCAdmin will import all the settings automatically.
:::

## How to Access the Plugin Repository

1. Log in to your TCAdmin control panel
2. Go to **Settings** > **Plugin Repositories**
3. Click on a repository to browse what's available

## The Default Repository

TCAdmin includes an **official plugin repository** maintained by the TCAdmin team. It comes pre-configured and contains game configurations, Docker blueprints, and other plugins for popular games. You can't delete or modify this repository, but you can add your own alongside it.

## Browsing Plugins

When you open a repository, plugins are organized into tabs:

| Tab | What's In It |
|-----|-------------|
| **Games** | Game server configurations — Minecraft, CS2, Rust, ARK, and many more |
| **Docker** | Docker container blueprints for running services in containers |
| **Scripts** | Automation scripts that run when game server events happen (start, stop, install, etc.) |
| **Themes** | Visual themes to customize how the control panel looks |
| **Languages** | Translation packs to display the control panel in different languages |

Each plugin card shows the name, author, description, version, tags, and when it was last updated.

## Installing a Plugin

1. Find the plugin you want and click **View Details**
2. Select the **Version** you want to install (latest is usually best)
3. If the plugin includes multiple configuration files, select the one you want
4. Optionally, select an existing item to **update** instead of creating a new one
5. Click **Install**

The installation runs in the background. A dialog shows progress and any messages.

:::warning About updating existing items
When you choose to update an existing game, Docker blueprint, script, theme, or language, your **custom changes will be overwritten**. If you've made customizations you want to keep, either skip the update or back up your changes first.

## Adding Third-Party Repositories

The community and third-party developers can create their own plugin repositories. To add one:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Plugin Repositories**
2. Click **Add**
3. Fill in:
   - **Name** — a name to identify this repository (e.g., "Community Plugins")
   - **Git URL** — the repository's Git URL (provided by the repository author)
   - **Branch** — usually `master` or `main` (check the repository's documentation)
   - **Credential** — select a saved credential if the repository is private
4. Click **Save**

:::warning Be careful with third-party repositories
Plugins can contain scripts that **run on your server**. Only add repositories from sources you trust. Malicious plugins could potentially harm your server or steal data.
:::

## Syncing Repositories

Repositories automatically sync their content from the Git source. If a repository shows **"Not Synced"**:

1. Open the repository
2. Click **Sync Repository**
3. Wait for it to finish

Status meanings:
- **Synced** — up to date, everything is good
- **Not Synced** — needs to pull the latest changes (may show how many commits behind)

## Managing Credentials for Private Repositories

If a third-party repository is private (requires authentication):

1. Go to **Settings** > **Plugin Repositories**
2. Click **Credentials** in the left menu
3. Click **Add** to create a new credential
4. Enter the username and password/token (usually a Git personal access token)
5. Save, then select this credential when adding or editing the private repository

## What Each Plugin Type Does

### Game Configurations

These are complete, ready-to-use setups for specific game servers. They include:
- The path to the game server executable and its startup command
- Default ports and query settings
- Steam integration (for games that use SteamCMD to install/update)
- File manager templates (which files users can edit)
- Default scripts and variables

**Example:** Installing the "Minecraft Java" plugin gives you a fully configured Minecraft game that you can immediately use to create game servers for your users.

### Docker Blueprints

Pre-configured Docker container setups including image name, port mappings, volume mounts, environment variables, and resource limits.

### Scripts

Scripts automate things that happen during game server events:
- **Game Scripts** — run when a game server starts, stops, installs, updates, etc.
- **Docker Scripts** — run during Docker container lifecycle events
- **Script Modules** — reusable code libraries that other scripts can call

### Themes

Custom visual designs for the control panel — different colors, layouts, and styling.

### Languages

Translation packs that let you (and your users) view the control panel in different languages.
