# Plugin Repository

The Plugin Repository allows you to browse, install, and update game configurations, Docker blueprints, scripts, themes, and language packs from centralized repositories.

## Accessing the Plugin Repository

1. Go to **Settings** > **Plugin Repositories**
2. Click on a repository to browse its contents

## Default Repository

TCAdmin includes a default plugin repository maintained by TCAdmin that contains official game configurations and other plugins. This repository cannot be deleted or modified.

## Browsing Plugins

When you open a repository, plugins are organized into tabs:

| Tab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Games** | Game server configurations (Minecraft, CS2, Rust, ARK, etc.) |
| **Docker** | Docker blueprint configurations for containerized services |
| **Scripts** | Game scripts, Docker scripts, and script modules |
| **Themes** | UI themes to customize the control panel appearance |
| **Languages** | Language packs for localization |

Each plugin card displays:
- Plugin name and author
- Short description
- Version number and available versions
- Tags for categorization
- Last update time

## Installing a Plugin

1. Click **View Details** on a plugin card
2. Select the **Version** you want to install
3. Select the specific configuration file (some plugins include multiple configurations)
4. Optionally select an existing item to update instead of creating a new one
5. Click **Install**

The installation runs as a background task. A dialog will show the progress and any messages.

:::warning Updating Existing Items
When installing a plugin, you can choose to update an existing game, Docker blueprint, script, theme, or language instead of creating a new one. If you made customizations to the existing item, they will be lost.

## Adding Third-Party Repositories

You can add additional plugin repositories from third-party sources:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Plugin Repositories**
2. Click **Add**
3. Enter the repository details:
   - **Name** - A friendly name for the repository
   - **Git URL** - The Git repository URL
   - **Branch** - The branch to use (default: `master`)
   - **Credential** - Select a saved credential for private repositories
4. Click **Save**

:::warning Security Notice
Third-party plugin repositories are added at your own risk. Plugins can contain code that executes on your server. Only add repositories from sources you trust.
:::

## Repository Sync

Repositories sync automatically from their Git source. If a repository shows "Not Synced":

1. Open the repository
2. Click **Sync Repository**
3. Wait for the sync to complete

The sync status shows:
- **Synced** - Repository is up to date
- **Not Synced** - Repository needs to sync (may show commits ahead/behind)

## Credentials

For private Git repositories, you can save credentials:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Plugin Repositories**
2. Click **Credentials** in the left menu
3. Click **Add** to create a new credential
4. Enter the username and password/token
5. Save the credential

You can then select this credential when adding or editing a repository.
