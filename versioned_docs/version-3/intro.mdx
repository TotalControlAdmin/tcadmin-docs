# TCAdmin v3 Documentation

:::info Work in Progress
The documentation for TCAdmin v3 is currently in development.
:::

## v3 Preview


:::info Licensing
You can use your existing TCAdmin **v2** master license to activate TCAdmin **v3** on the same machine. This lets you install TCAdmin v3 alongside TCAdmin v2 so you can run both versions at the same time, or install only v3 on that server and use your v2 license there.

If you want to install TCAdmin v3 on a different machine than the one your v2 license is assigned to, you will need a separate TCAdmin v2 trial key for that machine. Contact our sales or support team to request a trial key for evaluation on a separate server.
:::

## What's New in v3

Documentation for the new features and improvements in TCAdmin v3 will be available here soon.
